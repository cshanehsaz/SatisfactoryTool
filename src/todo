Big:
- make database of machines and materials
- add snap building and foundations
- sidebar dropdown with all machines
- conveyers
- materials per second totals
- fix cursor problems
- PRIORITY: setup proxy so that we can fetch from localhost to test machineNode connection to database  
                ideally, when you click and a new node is made, it should pull all the input and output data
                and keep it stored in state

Small:
- change the event listener for mouse dragging to canvas instead of app
- when rendering the array of all machines, the key is bad right now
- combine all machine components to render inside of machine


Long-term:
- saving (persistance)
- overclocking
- electricity
- toggle machine names feature
- "optimize" feature: show where bottlenecks are, where buffers should go. etc
- zooming in and out
- view by vertical slice (esp conveyers and pipes)
- add waste for refineries (things with 2 outputs)
- add building by size
